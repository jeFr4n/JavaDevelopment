# Getting Started

*Some PCs might have Java already installed.*

To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

`C:\Users\Your Name>java -version`

If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):

```
java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
```

If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at [oracle.com.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html)

    3. Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button
